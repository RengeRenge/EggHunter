abstract = {When an octopus grasps something, the rigidity of its tentacle can change greatly, which allowing for unlimited freedom, agility, and precision. Inspired by this, a three-finger flexible bionic robot gripper was designed for apple picking. First, a flexible chamber finger was designed to drive the gripper finger to elongate, shorten, and bend, which works through a process of inflating and deflating. Further, we proposed a three-finger mode to achieve two kinds of motion states: grasping and relaxing, by simulating the movement of an octopus grasping at something. In this paper, we evaluated the bending property of the designed flexible bionic gripper through an apple grasping experiment. The experimental results show that the 100.0 g bionic gripper can load an apple with a weight of 246.5~350.0 g and a diameter of 69.0~99.0 mm, and the grasping success rate is 100%. It has a good grasping performance. Compared to other soft grippers, the proposed bionic flexible gripper has the advantages of being lightweight, and having good cushioning, low driving air pressure, and a strong grasping force.},

abstract = {•A deep-learning-based flexible four-finger gripper grasping detection method.•A tool for marking pixel-level labels.•A powerful neural network.•Capable of grasping a wide variety of objects.
The flexible four-finger gripper, as a specialized robotic end-effector, is highly valued for its ability to passively adapt to the shape of objects and perform non-destructive grasping. However, the development of grasping detection algorithms for flexible four-finger grippers remains relatively unexplored. This paper addresses the unique characteristics of the flexible four-finger gripper by proposing a grasping detection method based on deep learning. Firstly, the Acute Angle Representation model (AAR-model), which is based on the structure of the flexible four-finger gripper and consists of grasp points and angles, is designed as the grasping representation model that reduces unnecessary rotations of the gripper and improves its versatility in grasping objects. Then, the Flexible Gripper Adaptive Attribute model (FGAA-model) is proposed to represent the grasping attributes of objects, calculate the grasp angles that meet the criteria of the AAR-model, and aggregate the AAR-models on the image data into a unified set, thereby circumventing the time-consuming process of pixel-level annotation. Finally, the Adaptive Grasping Neural Net (AGNN), which is based on Adaptive Feature Fusion and the Grasp Aware Network (AFFGA), is introduced by eliminating redundant network detection headers, fusing color and depth images as inputs, and incorporating a Series Atrous Spatial Pyramid (SASP) structure to produce more accurate grasp poses. Our method not only attains a remarkable accuracy of 97.62% on the Cornell dataset but also swiftly completes grasping detection within 25 ms. In practical robotic arm grasping tests, where a robot is outfitted with a flexible four-finger gripper, it successfully grasps unknown objects with a 96% success rate. These results underscore the reliability and real-time performance of our method, significantly enhancing the gripper's adaptability and precision when handling objects of varying sizes and shapes. This advancement provides a powerful technical solution for robots utilizing flexible four-finger grippers, enabling autonomous, real-time, and highly accurate grasping maneuvers. Moreover, it addresses the persistent challenge of the scarcity of efficient grasping detection techniques tailored for flexible four-finger grippers.},

abstract = {This paper presents a hybrid adaptive control strategy for upper limb rehabilitation robots using impedance learning. The hybrid adaptation consists of a differential updating mechanism for the estimation of robotic modeling uncertainties and periodic adaptations for the online learning of time-varying impedance. The proposed hybrid adaptive controller guarantees asymptotical control stability and achieves variable impedance regulation for robots without interaction force measurements. According to Lyapunov’s theory, we proved that the proposed impedance learning controller guarantees the convergence of tracking errors and ensures the boundedness of the estimation errors of robotic uncertainties and impedance profiles. Simulations and experiments conducted on a parallel robot validated the effectiveness and the superiority of the proposed impedance learning controller in robot-assisted rehabilitation. The proposed hybrid adaptive control has potential applications in rehabilitation, exoskeletons, and some other repetitive interactive tasks.},

In industrial quail farming settings, conventional egg retrieval systems rely on multiple conveyor belts connected to stacked layers of cages. Although they are effective, these systems lack precision in monitoring flocks and the quality of eggs at the level of individual cages. As a result, when defective eggs are laid, farmers are unable to trace their origin or understand the underlying causes, creating a gap in identifying sanitary risks and preventing the spread of diseases and infections. This study introduces a new concept for quail egg retrieval in poultry production. The proposed system consists of a 5-degree-of-freedom (5-DoF) cartesian robotic manipulator with a mounted conveyor belt integrated with a machine vision system based on oriented localization algorithms for precise egg collection directly at the cage level. Four base model algorithms—R3Det, Oriented R-CNN, OBB RetinaNet, and YOLOv8x-OBB—were evaluated for performance in egg detection and orientation. The machine vision system achieved the highest accuracy when embedded with Oriented R-CNN, followed by OBB RetinaNet, R3Det, and YOLOv8x-OBB, with RMSE values of 2.9, 3.87, 5.67, and 11.2, respectively, for the oriented picking of eggs. A comparative evaluation of three stepper motor resolutions revealed trade-offs between speed and precision when eggs were picked from cages. The theoretical picking rates ranged from 457 eggs/h to 290 and 149 eggs/h, corresponding to faster to slower operation cycles, respectively. Overall, the proposed system supports the development of next-generation smart sensors for in-cage egg quality and sanitary monitoring, enabling more effective and traceable poultry production.},

abstract = {In this article, the concurrent optimal design of a planar five-bar parallel robot for a high-speed pick and place task is considered. A trade-off between trajectory tracking, energy consumption and deformation of the flexible links is sought. Due to the high-speed operation, the minimization of the vibratory effect is considered since the design stage. Thus, the design is stated as a non-linear multi-objective dynamic optimization problem that is solved through the Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm, as well as, feasibility rules for constraints handling. Mechanical structural variables that modify the inertial parameters of the rigid and flexible links, as well as, control variables related to gains of a PID controller are considered as independent variables. This problem is subject to maximum torque that each motor could provide; inherent constraints for link manufacture; dimensional synthesis; Grashof's criterion and initial and boundary conditions. Results show that it is possible, despite the vibrational phenomenon, to reduce the energy consumption without loss of precision through an appropriate mass balance of the actuated links.},

abstract = {A study on trajectory planning and optimization for a Par4 parallel robot was carried out, based on energy consumption in high-speed picking and placing. In the end-effector operating space of the Par4 parallel robot, the rectangular transition of the pick-and-place trajectory was rounded by a Lamé curve. A piecewise design method was adopted to accomplish trajectory shape planning for displacement, velocity and acceleration. To make the Par4 robot’s end run more smoothly and to reduce residual vibration, asymmetric fifth-order and sixth-order polynomial motion laws were employed. With the aim of reaching the minimum mechanical energy consumption for the Par4 parallel robot, the recently proposed Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) algorithm was adopted to optimize the planning trajectory. The validity of the design method was verified by experiments, and it was found that the minimum mechanical energy consumption of the optimal trajectory planned under the law of fifth-order polynomial motion is lower than that of sixth-order polynomial motion. In addition, the experiments also revealed the optimal values of Parameters e and f, which were the parameters of the Lamé curve function. Parameter e can be calculated as half the pick-up span for the minimum mechanical energy consumption, unlike parameter f, whose optimal value depends on specific circumstances such as the pick-and-place coordinates and the pick-up height.},

abstract = {A Mobile Cable-Driven Parallel Robot (MCDPR) is composed of a classical Cable-Driven Parallel Robot (CDPR) carried by multiple mobile bases. The additional mobilities due the motion of the mobile bases allow such systems to autonomously modify their geometric architecture, and thus make them suitable for multiple manipulation tasks in constrained environments. Moreover, these additional mobilities mean MCDPRs are kinematically redundant and may use this redundancy to optimize secondary task criteria. However, the high dimensional state space and closed chain constraints add complexity to the motion planning problem. To overcome this, we propose a method for trajectory planning for MCDPRs performing pick and place operations in cluttered environments by using direct transcription optimization. Two different scenarios have been considered and their results are validated using a dynamic simulation software (V-REP) and experimentally.},
